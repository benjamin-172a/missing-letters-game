# Missing letters game
This small game featuring a GUI is made using Python's tkinter library!

## Rules
There is a 5x5 grid, and in the first stage there will be only one letter in the grid. You need to type any letter except the one displayed and press enter. Then, you move on to stage 2 where the grid will be regenerated with two distinct letters, and you need to type any letter not present in the grid and press enter. This continues with more letters being generated at each stage, until stage 25 where all but one of the letters of the alphabet will be displayed and you need to identify the single letter that is missing. You have 60 seconds to complete the game, and after any incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be lost and you will need to try again with the same grid.
